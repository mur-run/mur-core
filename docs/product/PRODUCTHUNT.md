## Maker Comment Draft

> Hey Product Hunt! 👋
>
> I built MUR because I kept teaching AI assistants the same patterns over and over. "Use Swift Testing instead of XCTest." "Wrap errors with context." "Use this Docker pattern."
>
> MUR Core captures these patterns once and injects them automatically. It's like building muscle memory for your AI tools.
>
> **How it works:**
> 1. Install MUR CLI
> 2. Run `mur init --hooks`
> 3. Use your AI tools normally
> 4. Patterns are captured and reused
>
> Works with Claude Code, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, Aider, Continue.dev, and more.
>
> The free tier is fully functional for personal use. Pro adds cloud sync. Team adds collaboration.
>
> Would love your feedback! 🙏
